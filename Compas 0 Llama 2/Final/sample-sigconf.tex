\section{Introduction}
In Natural Language Processing (NLP), fine-tuning large-scale language models has become essential for allowing models to perform remarkably well when they adapt to particular tasks and domains. The adaptability and efficiency of Llama2 among these models throughout a range of NLP tasks makes it stand out. However, the efficiency of fine-tuning Llama2 inference remains a critical concern, particularly in resource-constrained environments. The effectiveness of optimizing Llama2 inference depends on the language implementation selected, yet there is a lack of thorough knowledge on how various implementations affect effectiveness. The lack of understanding in this area poses a significant obstacle for researchers and practitioners who aim to maximize Llama2 model performance while minimizing resource use. Therefore, the central focus of this study is to address this gap by conducting a comparative exploration of language implementations for optimal efficiency in fine-tuning Llama2 inference.
To address the uncertainty surrounding the efficiency of fine-tuning Llama2 inference, the research question driving this study is: How do different language implementations affect the efficiency of fine-tuning Llama2 inference, and which implementation offers the optimal balance between performance and resource utilization? This study aims to evaluate various language implementations, including Python, C++, and Mojo, to assess and compare their efficiency in fine-tuning Llama2 inference. Important performance indicators will be compared across several language implementations, including inference speed, memory usage, and computational resources. The analysis attempts to determine the benefits and drawbacks of each implementation to assist practitioners and researchers in making informed decisions.
By offering insights on the selection and optimization of language implementations for Llama2 model fine-tuning, this research ultimately seeks to advance natural language processing approaches. The study aims to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of NLP systems and applications by closing the knowledge gap between theory and practice.
Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as revolutionary tools for various tasks, including natural language processing, machine translation, and code generation. Llama2, a cutting-edge LLM developed by Meta AI, has received widespread notice for its outstanding features and open-source accessibility. However, efficient inference with LLMs remains a significant issue, especially on devices with limited resources.
The computational demands of LLM inference often necessitate specialized hardware or cloud-based solutions, hindering their deployment in edge computing scenarios or on personal devices. The recent introduction of the Mojo SDK by Modular AI offers a promising solution for efficient LLM inference on Apple Silicon. Mojo is a new programming language and platform created exclusively for machine learning, combining low-level language performance with Python's usability. Its compatibility with the Python ecosystem and its focus on hardware acceleration and optimized libraries positions Mojo as a potentially transformative tool for LLM deployment.
This paper aims to evaluate and compare the performance of Mojo SDK for Llama2 inference on Apple Silicon against established implementations in various programming languages. The authors conduct comprehensive benchmarking across Llama2 models and thread configurations, analyzing key metrics such as tokens per second, inference time, and memory usage. Our results demonstrate that Mojo SDK achieves competitive performance while offering significant advantages in ease of use and development efficiency. This paper contributes to the ongoing exploration of efficient LLM deployment strategies. It highlights the potential of Mojo SDK as a powerful tool for unlocking the capabilities of LLMs on resource-constrained devices.



\section{Background Study}
MeZO, as mentioned in this paper, adapts the classical ZO-SGD method to operate in-place, thereby fine-tuning LLMs with the same memory footprint as inference, and shows that adequate pre-training and task prompts enable MeZO to fine-tune huge models \cite{malladi2024fine}. LLaMA-Adapter efficiently fine-tunes LLaMA with minimal parameters, introducing adaptive cues while preserving pre-trained knowledge, enabling high-quality responses and superior reasoning performance in multi-modal tasks. The authors adopted a set of learnable adaption prompts. They prepended them to the word tokens at higher transformer layers, which adaptively injects the new instructional cues into LLaMA while effectively preserving its pre-trained knowledge \cite{zhang2023llama}. Learner modules and priming, as discussed by the authors, exploit the overparameterization of pre-trained language models to gain benefits in convergence speed and resource utilization of BERT-based models \cite{vucetic2022efficient}. Inference-Time Intervention (ITI), as discussed by the authors, is a technique designed to enhance the truthfulness of large language models (LLMs) by shifting model activations during inference, following a set of directions across a limited number of attention heads \cite{li2023inference}. This article revisited kNN classifiers for augmenting pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) with textual representations of PLMs in two steps: (1) Utilizing kNN as prior knowledge to calibrate the training process and (2) Linearly interpolate the probability distribution predicted by kNN with that of the PLMs' classifier \cite{li2023revisiting}. LlamaTune, as mentioned in this paper, employs an automated dimensionality reduction technique based on randomized projections, a biased sampling approach to handle unique values for sure knobs, and knob values bucketization, to reduce the size of the search space \cite{kanellis2022llamatune}. As discussed by the authors, the delta-tuning approach optimizes a small portion of the model parameters while keeping the rest fixed, drastically cutting down computation and storage costs, and demonstrates that large-scale models could be effectively stimulated by optimizing a few parameters \cite{antonello2020selecting}. This work develops a contrastive self-training framework, COSINE, to enable fine-tuning LMs with weak supervision, underpinned by contrastive regularization and confidence-based reweighting, which gradually improves model fitting while effectively suppressing error propagation \cite{yu2020fine}.

\section{Methodology}
The methodology of this work compares Llama2 inference's efficacy across different programming languages and frameworks using a methodical technique. A thorough evaluation and benchmarking process is carried out on TensorFlow, PyTorch, Python, Mojo, C++, and Java, taking into account variables like performance, memory usage, and simplicity of use. The Mojo SDK's performance on Apple Silicon is also carefully assessed by contrasting it with well-known implementations in C, C++, Rust, Zig, Go, and Julia. Insights regarding the effectiveness and viability of each strategy are obtained through thorough benchmarking on an Apple M1 Max, helping to shape optimization techniques and emphasizing the competitive advantages of Mojo SDK, especially its compatibility with Python and simplicity of use on Apple Silicon hardware.

  \caption{Benchmarking Process for Evaluating Llama2 Implementations across Model Sizes and Threading Configurations.}
\end{figure}

The flowchart (Figure 1) outlines a benchmarking process for evaluating different implementations of the Llama2 system across various model sizes and threading configurations. It starts by defining model sizes and selecting implementations in other programming languages. Then, it splits into two paths to run single-threaded and multi-threaded benchmarks using the hypertune tool. After collecting performance metrics like TPS, inference time, and memory usage, the results are analyzed to compare implementations across models and threading. Finally, insights are drawn from the analysis to conclude the benchmarking process.


\subsection{Testing Environment and Hardware}
The benchmarking was carried out on a MacBook Pro outfitted with an Apple M2 Max SoC, boasting a 10-core CPU, a 32-core GPU, and a 16-core Neural Engine. This hardware setup provides a robust and pertinent environment for assessing LLM inference performance on Apple Silicon. All tests were conducted solely in CPU-only mode to ensure consistency and isolate the performance of the language implementations.

\subsection{Benchmarking Framework and Tools}
To ensure reliable and comparable performance measurements, we implemented a custom benchmarking framework designed to execute LLM inference tasks consistently across all language implementations. We utilized the “Hypertune” tool, a fork of the popular hyperfine command-line benchmarking utility, with enhanced features for granular performance data capture. This allowed us to measure and record key metrics, including tokens per second, time per inference, and memory usage.


\subsection{Performance Metrics}
Two fundamental performance metrics were employed to assess the efficacy of LLM implementations: tokens per second and time per inference. Tokens per second quantifies the processing speed, reflecting the model's throughput, while time per inference measures the average duration for completing a single inference step, indicative of responsiveness and latency.

\subsection{Testing Process}
\subsubsection{Single-Threaded and Multi-Threaded Configurations: }
Each language implementation underwent testing in both single-threaded and multi-threaded configurations, where feasible, to assess its scalability and efficiency in leveraging available CPU cores. Multi-threaded tests were conducted with varying thread counts to explore the impact of parallel processing on performance.

\subsubsection{Model Conversion: }
To ensure equitable comparison across implementations, the Llama2 models were converted to the fp32 GGUF format utilizing the llama.cpp converter tool. This step was imperative to accommodate potential differences in model format requirements across implementations. Subsequently, each implementation loaded and executed the converted models for benchmarking purposes.

\subsubsection{Inference Execution: }
A series of inference tasks were executed using each implementation and model combination, with performance metrics recorded for subsequent analysis. These inference tasks involved presenting prompts and generating text completions, mirroring real-world LLM usage scenarios. Collected results were meticulously analyzed to discern and compare the performance characteristics of each implementation.

\subsection{Data Collection and Analysis}
The amassed performance data underwent rigorous scrutiny, employing statistical techniques and visualization tools to uncover nuanced insights. Through comparative analysis, trends in performance across different implementations were elucidated, allowing for a comprehensive evaluation of their strengths and weaknesses. By juxtaposing the performance of Mojo SDK with other established implementations, the study sought to highlight its comparative advantages and potential areas for improvement. The findings of this analysis served as the basis for drawing meaningful conclusions regarding the efficacy and suitability of Mojo SDK for LLM inference tasks on Apple Silicon.

\subsection{Multi-Threaded Performance Comparison}
The multi-threaded benchmarks conducted by the authors provide valuable insights into the performance of Mojo SDK and other language implementations for Llama2 inference. Key findings include:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Mojo SDK consistently demonstrates competitive performance across all model sizes, indicating its effectiveness regarding tokens per second and inference time. While not always the top performer, Mojo's Python-like usability and low-level optimization combination contribute to efficient LLM inference. Moreover, Mojo scales well with larger models, narrowing the performance gap with other implementations.
  \item C++ and Zig implementations exhibit strong performance, which is particularly noticeable in larger models. This underscores their suitability for computationally intensive tasks and effective utilization of modern hardware capabilities.
  \item Go, Rust, and Julia perform moderately, offering reasonable efficiency for LLM inference tasks. Additional optimizations and platform-specific tuning could further enhance their performance.
